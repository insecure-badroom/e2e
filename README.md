# e2e
An end to end encryption tool in a single html file.

# How to use
whenever you reload the page it creates a new public key. Give this to whoever you are chatting with. They can paste it in and encrypt a message. After that, only you can decrypt it. It uses hybrid encryption.

# Credits
Me and Gemini. I am way to dumb to code actual RSA encryption. The only thing I did was come up with ideas and do minor changes and review the code. This deserves to be in insecure badroom because all the projects are vibecoded.
